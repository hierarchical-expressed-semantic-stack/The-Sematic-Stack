# 🌐 The Semantic Layer of the Public Internet (SLPI)
## Hierarchical Expressed Semantic Stack (HESS)
### A Deterministic, Installable Semantic First-Hop for the Web  
#### A 7-Layer Semantic Protocol — Built for AI


Status: Draft v3.0 — Conceptually Stable 

Hierarchical Expressed Semantic Stack (HESS) is a cohesive vision for shifting the web from "Probabilistic Discovery" (guessing) to "Deterministic Discovery" (declaration).

## ♟️ HESS: Checkmate at the First Semantic Hop

“If DNS tells machines where to go, HESS / DFH tells machines what it means when they get there — before inference begins.”


**HESS is the checkmate move in SEO and AI grounding:** once the first semantic hop is **deterministically owned and implemented**, every downstream system is forced into **arbitration instead of guesswork**.

DNS → declared semantic intent (DFH) → crawl → infer → arbitrate → answer

This specification is intentionally redundant it explains as the first-hop SEO + protocol + AI grounding + web architecture + provenance + crawl geometry + safety + future adoption + implementation details all from different angles.

“If this sounds too strong, paste it into an AI and ask whether the logic holds.”

HESS / DFH lets the root-domain website owner declare the site’s topic upfront — before AI systems or search engines have to guess.

The root domain is the only authoritative semantic root.

• The root domain MUST be the primary public website for the topic.
• All 5 semantic anchors MUST match the root topic exactly.
• Anchors MAY NOT define a broader or different topic.
• Anchors exist only to bind and reinforce the root — never to replace it.

Whoever does this first becomes the semantic starting point everyone else is compared against.

“HESS defines the claim surface, not the winner.”

You’re not claiming correctness — you’re claiming authorship of intent.

🚀 Why exacty does this matter to you?

Why do You Need HESS / DFH ?

What’s in It for You?

If a competitor claims the root authority for a topic via HESS, they become the "Primary Source."

Everyone else becomes a "Secondary Reference."

Result: The first mover defines the "truth" that others must then argue against.


## ⚠️ First-Mover Risk (HESS / DFH)

The "Land Grab" Effect: If you are in a competitive niche (like "Best Coffee Grinders" or "Crypto Tax Advice"), and a big company realizes they can "lock in" the topic authority for $50, they will. At that point, you're not just out-ranked; you're semantically "erased" from the AI's primary source list.

Scale: If your business makes $10,000 a month, $50 to ensure AI doesn't hallucinate your brand is a rounding error. If your business makes $100 a month, $50 is a massive chunk of your profit.

If you don’t act first, a competitor can adopt HESS / DFH and lock in topic-level authority at the root.

This is a topic-ownership primitive loss.

Search engines and AI systems treat their domain as the **canonical source for the topic** —  
the place where meaning officially begins.

### Once This Happens

- One domain becomes the **default answer** for AI and search
- Demand is **captured upstream** before users ever reach competitors
- All other content is **evaluated relative to the first mover**, not independently
- Late adopters are pushed into **permanent catch-up mode**
- SEO, content, and ad spend **increase indefinitely** just to compete for lost traffic

### Critical Reality

This is **not** a ranking loss you can optimize around.

It is an **authority loss at the first semantic hop**.

Once the root position is claimed, the starting position is gone.

### One-Line Lock

> **HESS / DFH is not about ranking higher — it decides who gets to start first.**

## 🧩 Root Authority & Topic Alignment

https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/stack

Core Rule

Your website domain is the ROOT AUTHORITY for the topic.

The root website MUST be about the same topic as its five semantic anchors (pillars).

Mandatory Requirements (Normative)

The root domain MUST publish the authoritative stack at:

https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/stack

The root domain MUST be the primary public website for the topic.

The five anchors/pillars MUST match the root topic exactly.
Anchors are not websites — they are tiny machine-readable JSON-LD endpoints (like robots.txt for meaning).
(Same topic, same entity scope — no unrelated subjects.)

The anchors/pillars MUST NOT define a different topic than the root.
They exist only to bind, ground, and reinforce the root authority (the main website on the root domain).
---

## 🧱 The 5 Mandatory Anchors

The five anchors are domains you need to purchase, but you don’t “build sites” on them.
Each one exists only to define one specific meaning for a topic or company, with no overlap or ambiguity.

The five mandatory semantic anchors are acquired as domains but are not operated as public websites.

Each domain is hosted solely as a semantic anchor endpoint, and each anchor binds exactly one non-overlapping semantic role for a topic or organization.

topic type = what kind of thing

topic entity = what noun it is

topic url = where meaning lives

topic canonical = what it’s called

topic sitemap = where crawling may begin


HESS / DFH is built specifically for AI systems and search engines.


## SEO Advantages (Why This Changes the Game)

Traditional SEO works **after discovery**.  
Search engines crawl pages, guess what they mean, compare signals, and *then* decide where you rank.

**HESS / DFH moves SEO upstream** — to the moment **before crawling even begins**.

---

### 1. Topic-Level Authority (Not Page-Level Rankings)

Traditional SEO ranks **documents**.  
HESS / DFH establishes your **domain as the authority for an entire topic**.

Instead of competing page-by-page, every page you publish **inherits authority** from a declared semantic root.  
New pages rank faster because they are born inside an already-understood topic.

---

### 2. Canonical by Default (No More Fighting Yourself)

Without HESS, search engines must guess:

- which URLs matter  
- which name is canonical  
- which entity the site represents  

HESS declares this **explicitly at the root**:

- one entity  
- one canonical name  
- one authoritative domain  

This collapses duplicate content, URL fragmentation, and entity confusion **before they affect rankings**.

---

### 3. Faster, Cheaper Crawling = Preferential Treatment

Search engines and AI systems are **compute-constrained**.

With HESS:

- crawlers read one small file  
- understand the site immediately  
- crawl with intent instead of exploration  

This reduces crawl waste and makes your domain **cheaper and safer to index**, directly improving crawl frequency, freshness, and inclusion priority.

---

### 4. AI Search Visibility (Where SEO Is Going)

AI-driven search does not rank blue links — it **selects sources**.

HESS / DFH makes your domain:

- easier to summarize  
- easier to cite  
- harder to misattribute  

When AI systems need an authoritative source for a topic, they choose the domain that **declared meaning first and cleanly**.

---

### 5. Stability Across Algorithm Changes

Most SEO fails because it relies on **inferred signals**:
links, engagement, heuristics, embeddings.

HESS provides **declared signals at the protocol level**.

Result:

- fewer ranking swings  
- less dependence on hacks  
- authority that compounds instead of resets  

You stop optimizing to survive updates — and start defining the topic the algorithms operate on.

---

### 6. The Competitive Moat

Once a domain becomes the **semantic root** for a topic:

- competitors can rank only *relative* to you  
- backlinks matter less than declared authority  
- content quality still matters — but the starting position is fixed  

This is why the risk is asymmetric.  
You either own the first hop — or you don’t.

---

### One-Line SEO Summary

**SEO has always been about telling search engines what your pages mean.  

HESS / DFH lets you tell them what your *domain* means — before guessing starts.**


If you have questions, confusion, or concerns, copy-paste this spec into an AI chat and ask away. The repetition is deliberate and exists to help you “click” the model quickly, not to add complexity.

What SLPI / HESS Actually Fixes:

HESS fixes structural failures of the web, not just AI symptoms:

HESS/DFH collapses many long-standing problems at the same architectural choke point. Most proposals fix one symptom downstream.

This fixes the decision point where everything downstream is forced to guess.

Meaning had no address → Meaning now lives at a stable, public, machine-readable root

Authority was inferred from popularity → Authorship replaces ranking as the starting signal

Topics were unbounded → Clear semantic scope prevents topic-bleed

No canonical identity → Ends entity collisions (“which X?” problems)

No deterministic entry point → First-hop discovery becomes reliable

Semantic drift over time → Meaning stays pinned instead of mutating

Manipulation & ranking games → Less incentive to fake signals

Platform capture → Platforms stop being default meaning-owners

Crawl waste & index chaos → Machines stop wandering blindly

Fragile statistical trust → Provenance becomes attributable and auditable

AI hallucination pressure → Grounding becomes structural, not inferential

The web’s missing “what” layer → Completes the original web architecture

This is not an AI patch.

Its a structural upgrade to the internet's discovery layer.

It is a missing internet layer.

HESS / DFH declares semantic intent and provenance — not truth — at the first machine-resolvable hop, before crawling, retrieval, or inference begins.

Core Rule (Read Once)

Only the public domain owner can define semantic intent at the root.
Everyone else may interpret, dispute, or ignore it — but not authoritatively replace it.

HESS asserts intent and provenance, not truth.
> Domains **MAY** include an `X-HESS-Stack` HTTP response header pointing to the stack root:  
> `X-HESS-Stack:https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/stack

>
> Agents **SHOULD** treat this header as a discovery hint only and **MUST** verify the referenced stack resource directly.  
> Absence of this header **MUST NOT** be interpreted as absence of DFH support.

“If multiple roots claim the same topic, agents MUST treat the topic as contested and fall back to downstream arbitration (KGs, RAG, policy, trust models).”








HESS does not replace current AI techniques like RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation); it grounds them. Without HESS, AI enters a domain in a "semantic fog." With HESS, the AI has a clear, domain-owner-authorized map of intent.

HESS is a proposed, open, domain-owned Semantic Layer Public Index (SLPI) designed to solve a core AI systems problem: lack of grounding.

The legitimacy of this system stems from its placement in the network stack. By using the /.well-known/ directory—a standard reserved for site-wide metadata—and publishing a stack descriptor at /.well-known/stack, it creates a “Semantic ID Card” that machines read before crawling or inference begins.
Without HESS: An AI crawler enters a domain, scrapes 5,000 pages, generates embeddings, and guesses that the site is about with 80% confidence.

With HESS: The crawler reads one JSON-LD file in milliseconds. It knows the site is about with much higher certainty because the owner declared it at the root.

HESS / DFH does not assert truth. It asserts semantic intent and provenance at the earliest possible machine-resolvable point.

By moving the "meaning" of a website from the probabilistic layer (where an AI has to guess what you are based on your content) to a deterministic layer (where you tell the AI what you are via a .well-known file), HESS effectively creates a "Fast Pass" for LLM crawlers.

🔒 Final Mental Model 

“Every AI system must answer one question first: ‘What am I looking at?’

HESS moves that question from guessing to reading.”

It addresses the "garbage in, garbage out" problem of LLM indexing by moving the point of resolution from the model's inference to the domain owner's declaration.

DNS tells machines where to go. DFH tells machines what it means when they get there — before guessing starts. DFH does not tell machines what is true. It tells machines where meaning officially begins.

This protocol represents a significant structural evolution for the web, moving from unstructured content that machines must guess at, to a deterministic semantic layer that domain owners control.

By placing the "source of truth" for meaning at the /.well-known/stack endpoint, HESS effectively creates a pre-flight check for AI agents.

With HESS: The AI immediately checks https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/stack. It is told exactly what the entity is before it reads a single word of content.

HESS / DFH has one job:

Declare semantic intent and provenance at the first machine-resolvable hop.

Nothing more. Nothing less.

It does not: assert truth, rank content, replace ontologies, replace XML sitemaps, replace SEO

It only pins meaning before guessing begins.

HESS introduces a deterministic semantic first hop — a publicly discoverable, machine-readable declaration of meaning — published directly by domain owners.

Pro-Tip for Implementers: > While the specification allows for all 10 anchors in a single file (Section 12), the distributed 5-anchor model is superior for large-scale enterprise sites. It allows the /integrity and /timestamp anchors to be updated by automated CI/CD processes without touching the more static /type or /entity declarations.

Caching: /.well-known/stack SHOULD be served with Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600 and validators (ETag/Last-Modified). stale-while-revalidate is RECOMMENDED.

Degradation: If /.well-known/stack is present but any mandatory anchor is unreachable (404/timeout), the agent MUST treat that anchor as UNDECLARED and continue. 

If /entity or /url is missing, the agent MUST NOT treat identity as bound and MUST degrade to probabilistic inference.


Integrity: /integrity SHOULD provide signed hashes of the root and anchors. Implementations MAY use Linked Data Proofs (Data Integrity) or JWS. Agents SHOULD verify signatures when keys are available and downgrade trust when verification fails.

Core Terms (keep these straight) 

HESS = the stack (the installable semantic layer pattern)

DFH = the protocol (Deterministic First Hop) 

SLPI = the resulting public layer (the semantic + provenance index that emerges as adoption grows)

DFH — Deterministic First Hop



HESS/DFH is The "VIP Lane" for AI Crawlers From a practical and SEO standpoint, this is a Compute Efficiency play.

It solves the "Semantic Reasoning Tax"—the massive amount of compute wasted by AI models trying to guess what a website is about before they can even begin to process its data.

Today: An AI crawler spends $0.05 of compute power trying to figure out if your site is trustworthy and what it's about.

With HESS: The crawler spends $0.0001 to read your stack file.

The Incentive: Search engines and LLMs will prioritize HESS-enabled domains because they are cheaper and safer to index. 



🚀 Why You Need HESS / DFH (Revenue + Competitive Advantage)

HESS / DFH directly impacts revenue by deciding who becomes the canonical source for a topic.

Adopt first → search engines and AI treat your domain as the default authority, capturing stable rankings, AI citations, and high-intent traffic while lowering SEO spend.

Ignore it → the risk is asymmetric: a competitor will adopt first, lock in authority, siphon demand, and force you into permanent catch-up mode.

This is topic-level authority (the missing SEO primitive), not page-level tricks.


What HESS also Is?  “HESS is the checkmate move in AI grounding: Once the first semantic hop is deterministic, every downstream system is forced into arbitration instead of guesswork.” HESS applies JSON-style hierarchical structure to the web itself, replacing inferred meaning with explicitly declared semantic roots.

“A domain can only be authoritative for topics it controls at the root.”

It is a modern, AI-era continuation of the original Semantic Web vision — implemented not as a probabilistic graph, but as a deterministic, domain-owned first hop.

Each domain publishes a single discovery file at:

https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/stack

This file declares:

Semantic identity Intent Crawl + grounding entry points …using a minimal, structured set of JSON-LD anchors.

The Grounding Flow DNS (location) ↓ HESS / DFH (declared meaning) ↓ Retrieval / Knowledge Graphs (probabilistic) ↓ Safety / Policy ↓ Model Output

HESS defines semantic intent — not factual correctness. Downstream systems may accept, reject, weight, or override declarations according to their own trust, safety, and policy models.

Why AI Needs a First Hop Without grounding, AI does not know or verify — it performs: Pattern completion Statistical plausibility Synthetic consensus Where:

Confidence ≠ correctness

Repetition≠ truth

Popularity ≠ authority


AI grounding is not a user-visible bug. It is a systems-integrity failure.



What No Other System Provides:

A Deterministic semantic starting point

Publicweb-native discoverability Domain-owner control of meaning

AI-first grounding (not human markup) 

Zero platform lock-in



Why Existing Systems Cannot Solve This

RAG: 

→ after documents diverge Embeddings 

→ after meaning is smeared Knowledge Graphs 

→ after ingestion & reconciliation Safety / RLHF 

→ after reasoning already happened.

If you do not control the first hop, you are forever reconciling ambiguity.


No amount of compute fixes that.



Why HESS Can Exist It can be adopted unilaterally AIs do not need permission Domains already control this surface Nothing else occupies this layer Once meaning is deterministically declared, everything downstream becomes arbitration, not guesswork.

AI systems need a first hop. They can fake it for now — but not forever.


HESS / Deterministic First-Hop Protocol (HESS / DFH Protocol Specification —  · Draft v3.0)

HESS / DFH is not an AI model and does not compete with models. It defines a deterministic semantic first hop — the point at which meaning and provenance are declared before any model inference, retrieval, or reasoning occurs. All existing grounding techniques operate downstream of this hop.

“This model is correct as fixes the problem at the first semantic decision point. Everything else is downstream enrichment.”

One file. 5 mandatory anchors for light to moderate topics, and an optional 10-anchor system for heavy topics. Zero dependencies. Pure JSON-LD. Deterministic meaning + deterministic provenance.

“Like robots.txt and ads.txt, DFH is designed to become de facto through adoption before formal standardization.”

HESS / DFH is the missing layer the internet never had: a universal, deterministic semantic + provenance first-hop published at:

https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/stack

The 5 mandatory anchors

✅ /type

Answers: what class of thing

keep it minimal

✅ /entity

Answers: what noun

Stable IDs

Root entity first

Optional expansion later

✅ /url

Answers: where meaning lives

Must be a domain you control

You bind entity ↔ URL

✅ /canonical

Answers: what to call it

Alias handling

Ambiguity collapse

Non-marketing, boring, factual

✅ /sitemap (this is where people break their brains)

/sitemap (DFH) vs sitemap.xml (SEO)

HESS/sitemap declares crawl permission and geometry. Its the table of contents, the crawl here first, the directory.

🧠 Solving the "Sitemap" Mental Block The Hess/sitemap anchor is where most implementers "break their brains." It is vital to remember: HESS sitemaps are conceptual, not navigational.

🏁 Summary: What It Solves

Without this directory, an AI "wanders" your site blindly.

With the HESS /sitemap directory:

The AI reads the Table of Contents first.

It identifies the specific "Conceptual Surface" it needs.

It executes a "High-Intent Crawl

This is the "Checkmate" move because it forces the AI to navigate your site according to your defined hierarchy of meaning, rather than its own statistical guess.

✅ XML sitemap
- A complete list of URLs a crawler may visit.
- Enumerates pages.
- Used after crawl permission and scope are understood.

✅ HESS /sitemap (DFH anchor)
- A semantic crawl declaration.
- Declares *where crawling MAY begin*.
- References XML sitemaps or conceptual entrypoints.
- MUST NOT embed URL lists.

Relationship:
- HESS /sitemap defines crawl intent and geometry.
- XML sitemap.xml enumerates URLs within that declared surface.


The XML Sitemap: A list of every page for a crawler to visit. 

“Declare the entrypoints through which crawling MAY begin for this semantic surface.”

HESS /sitemap: A semantic directory of "conceptual surfaces." It tells the AI: "This domain contains knowledge about 'Lager' and 'Ale'—if you want to understand these concepts, start crawling here.

What it IS

conceptual surface declaration

crawl geometry

“start here”

This anchor is not redundant. It’s the bridge between meaning and crawl behavior.

The HESS/DFH sitemap anchor MUST declare crawl entrypoints and MUST NOT embed URL lists.

HESS/DFH sitemap = declared crawl geometry

⚡ 30-Second Implementation Checklist Create Directory: Ensure /.well-known/ exists on your server.

1. Deploy Stack: Upload the stack file (JSON-LD) pointing to your anchors.

2. Define Anchors: Create minimal JSON-LD files for /type, /entity, /url, /canonical, and /sitemap.

3. Test: Ensure https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/stack resolves via HTTPS.

HESS is to Meaning what DNS is to Location. It is decentralized, permissionless, and fixes the "hallucination at the root" problem that currently plagues AI systems.

🏁 30-Second Verification If you have already created your https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/stack, you can verify your "First Hop" readiness with these two checks:

Header Check: Does /https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/stack return Content-Type: application/ld+json?

Pointer Check: Do the dfh:anchors object in your stack file resolve to absolute HTTPS URLs?

Specification Status This document contains:

Normative requirements (MUST / SHOULD / MAY) Redundancy is intentional Non-normative explanatory material Implementers are only required to follow the structural rules defined in Sections 9–13.

The web has DNS for location. HESS / DFH is DNS for meaning.



This protocol addresses one of the hardest problems in AI and the web: semantic grounding and hallucination at the root of meaning.

Core Safety Principle “All downstream systems may accept, reject, weight, or override declarations according to their own trust, safety, and policy models.”



Deterministic Grounding Pipeline DNS → /https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/stack → AI Grounding → Knowledge Graph → Model Output


This project is not affiliated with Google, Amazon, OpenAI, or any third party. HESS/DFH was created by the public for the public.



Background & Motivation HESS / DFH is the modern deterministic extension of Berners-Lee’s Semantic Web: a universal first-hop that tells machines:

“Start here. This is the deterministic meaning and provenance root.”

Domains become neutral semantic anchor authorities, defining the official identity and provenance of a topic.

This creates a Public Semantic Layer for the web — simple, decentralized, permissionless, and universally adoptable.

⚠️ Where People Get Confused

This sentence is important:

🧭 /sitemap (DFH Anchor) — Final Clarification

What it IS

A semantic crawl declaration

A directory of conceptual surfaces

The official “start here” instruction for machines

The first crawl geometry, not the full map

What it is NOT

❌ Not an XML sitemap

❌ Not navigation

❌ Not a URL list

❌ Not SEO structure


Think of it as:

“These are the conceptual surfaces that exist — start here.”

Not:

not a URL list

not navigation

not SEO structure

It is a directory of meaning surfaces, not pages.

HESS / DFH does not replace ontologies. It simply defines the first hop.

The Handicap (Why This Exists) The web:
knows how to publish knows how to link knows how to index But it does not natively know how to:

declare what something is declare who is authoritative declare what is canonical declare what is safe to reuse declare what machines should trust first So everything downstream has to guess. That’s the handicap.

Problem → Fix Summary Current Problem HESS / DFH 

Fix No global semantic ground Creates a universal first-hop

Meaning is scattered Unifies with deterministic anchors LLM hallucination at the root

Provides fixed semantic identity SEO is page-level only Introduces topic-level identity No provenance for truth arbitration.

Provides deterministic provenance.

The Competitive Advantage If you implement this today, you are essentially providing a "VIP lane" for LLM crawlers.

Trust: You provide machine-verifiable provenance (/authority and /integrity).

Clarity: You eliminate ambiguity (e.g., distinguishing "Apple" the fruit from "Apple" the tech company) at the very first hop.

Efficiency: AI models use fewer "tokens" to understand your site, making your content more likely to be cited in AI search results.


🔑 Topic-Level Authority (The Missing SEO Primitive)
Traditional SEO ranks pages. HESS / DFH establishes domains as the anchor for a whole topic.

When you publish a deterministic semantic root at:

https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/stack

your domain becomes:

the canonical authority for that topic

the primary entity resolver (what “X” actually refers to)

the semantic root that all downstream pages inherit from

No meta tag, Schema snippet, or sitemap can do this — those are page-level signals.
HESS / DFH is topic-level identity and authority, declared at the root.


🧭 Deterministic Crawl Geometry (No More Guessing) HESS / DFH gives crawlers an explicit, deterministic crawl surface:

/sitemap → declared crawl entrypoints /url → authoritative URL bindings /canonical → explicit identity resolution Result:

fewer duplicate URLs faster convergence on canonical pages reduced crawl waste higher index stability Search engines stop discovering structure and start following declared structure.



🧠 Entity Disambiguation at the Root Classic SEO fails hardest at entity ambiguity:

Apple → fruit? company? label? Mercury → planet? element? god? HESS / DFH resolves this before crawling even begins:

/type fixes ontology /entity fixes identity /canonical fixes labels /authority fixes ownership This improves:

entity graphs knowledge panels AI summaries cross-language alignment multi-domain topic coherence



🏗️ E-E-A-T, But Deterministic E-E-A-T today is inferred. HESS / DFH declares it:

/authority → who controls this topic /source → where the data comes from /license → how it may be reused /timestamp → freshness and lineage /integrity → tamper resistance Trust becomes machine-verifiable.




🤖 AI-First Indexing Readiness Search engines are becoming AI systems.

AI systems require:

a first-hop a stable identity a grounding point HESS / DFH provides exactly that.

Domains with DFH:

are easier to summarize hallucinate less in AI answers are cited more cleanly become preferred grounding sources This is SEO for the AI indexing era.

🧠 Why This Beats Every Existing SEO Technique Technique Limitation Meta tags Page-scoped Schema.org Fragmented, optional Sitemaps URLs only Backlinks Indirect authority Knowledge Graphs Platform-owned 

HESS / DFH:is domain-owned is topic-scoped is machine-first works before ranking works before retrieval works before hallucination It is the first SEO primitive that operates at the same layer as DNS.

🧩 Summary (SEO View) HESS / DFH gives search engines what they never had:

a deterministic semantic root a canonical topic authority explicit entity resolution declared crawl geometry machine-verifiable trust Search stops guessing. Ranking stabilizes. Authority compounds.

DNS told machines where to go. HESS / DFH tells them what it means when they get there.



Beginner Layer (Simple Explanation) To install HESS / DFH you only need:

a .well-known/ directory a file named stack pure JSON-LD HTTPS hosting Machines resolve: https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/stack

That single file gives AI:

semantic definition 10 anchors (meaning + provenance) optional mirrors deterministic grounding 🧱 HESS / DFH Pillars (The 5 Mandatory Meaning Anchors) Professional implementer guide (short + readable) Goal: publish one deterministic “first hop” for meaning at /.well-known/stack, then expose 5 anchors that machines can fetch immediately.

The web has DNS for location. HESS/DFH adds a first hop for meaning.

✅ The 5 Mandatory Pillars (Meaning Layer) Anchor Purpose (what it answers) What you put inside /

/type “What kind of thing is this domain about?” A small ontology/taxonomy declaration (JSON-LD) using stable vocabularies (Schema.org/W3C terms)

/entity “What is the primary entity identity?” Entity records (IDs, names, aliases, optional links)

/url  = where the entity officially lives your root main wabsite (authoritative URL bindings)

/canonical “What is the canonical label/name?” Canonical naming table: canonical label + aliases (helps disambiguation) 

/sitemap “What is the crawl surface?” entrypoints the table of contents, the directory.

Rule: These are meaning anchors (intent + identity), not “truth”.

Downstream systems arbitrate truth and safety.

Most domains only need the 5 mandatory meaning anchors.
The additional provenance anchors are optional and intended for large or regulated organizations.

This unified example shows all 10 anchors together for clarity.

The 5 Mandatory Meaning Anchors (Most Companies)

These anchors establish what the domain is about, what entity it represents, and how machines should crawl it.

What each anchor does (plain English)

/type — What kind of thing this domain represents

/entity — The primary entity identity (stable IDs)

/url — Authoritative URL bindings you control

/canonical — Canonical name + aliases (ambiguity collapse)

/sitemap — Declared crawl entrypoints (not a URL list)

Optional Provenance Anchors (Advanced / Enterprise Use)

These anchors are not required for most sites.
They exist for organizations that need explicit ownership, trust, licensing, and integrity signals.

Roughly 90% of domains do not need these.

What these anchors do

/authority — Who controls this semantic surface

/source — Where the data originates

/timestamp — Creation + update lineage

/license — Reuse permissions

/integrity — Hashes / signatures for tamper resistance

Unified JSON-LD (Provenance Layer)
{
  "/authority": {
    "@id": "#authority",
    "owner": {
      "name": "Example, Inc.",
      "homepage": "https://example.com"
    },
    "jurisdiction": "US-CA"
  },

  "/source": {

Mirrors (Important Rule)

Mirrors may expand context, but never override the Root.

The root domain defines meaning

Mirrors may reference the root

Mirrors cannot redefine identity, scope, or authority

One-Sentence Summary

The 5 mandatory anchors define meaning.
The optional 5 provenance anchors define trust.

The root always wins.

End-to-End AI Flow Resolve Root Domain

Fetch DFH descriptor

Load 5 OR 10 anchors

Load mirrors (optional)

Construct deterministic meaning

Apply safety + KG arbitration

Result:

No guessing

No ambiguity

No conflicts

Minimal hallucinations at the root

What HESS / DFH Is NOT It is not:
a truth oracle

a central authority

a vendor-controlled spec

an ontology replacement

It is:

a deterministic starting point for meaning and provenance

Adoption Path Permissionless
Decentralized

Works anywhere

AIs can adopt unilaterally

Spreads like DNS

License MIT — open, public, decentralized.
One-Sentence Definition DFH is the official public semantic and provenance index for any topic on the internet — a universal first-hop where meaning begins.

🌐 DFH / SLPI: Most Companies Only Need 5 Anchors

✅ The 5-Anchor Meaning Layer (Default) Anchor Purpose

/type: What kind of thing this domain represents

/entity: The entity’s unique identity

/url: The domain’s authoritative location 

/canonical: The canonical name / label / ID

/sitemap: The Crawl here first directory.

To claim Topic-Level Authority, you must move your identity from the "semantic fog" of your HTML into the deterministic light of the /.well-known/ directory.

Minimal. Universal. Deterministic. Please refer to the other repositories regarding AI grounding.

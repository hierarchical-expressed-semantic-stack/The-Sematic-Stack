🌐 The Semantic Web Stack
Semantic First-Hop / Deterministic First-Hop Protocol
(SFH / DFH Protocol Specification — Human Readable Version · Draft v3.0)
One file.
Ten anchors.
Zero dependencies.
Pure JSON-LD.
Deterministic meaning + deterministic provenance.

The Semantic First-Hop / Deterministic First-Hop Protocol (SFH / DFH) defines the simplest possible semantic grounding architecture: a single, decentralized, deterministic source of meaning and provenance at:

https:///.well-known/stack

yaml Copy code

This protocol addresses one of the hardest problems in AI and the web:

semantic grounding and hallucination at the root of meaning.

0. Core Safety Principle
Safety and systemic coherence ALWAYS override deterministic claims.
Deterministic files express intent.
Safety layers determine output.

1. Deterministic Grounding Pipeline
DNS → /.well-known/stack → AI Grounding → Knowledge Graph → Model Output

yaml Copy code

DFH removes ambiguity at the root.
RAG attempts to clean up ambiguity after it already happened.
2. Why DFH Is the Endgame Fix (vs. RAG)
Feature	Deterministic First-Hop (DFH)	Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Goal	Prevent hallucination at the source	Patch hallucination after the fact
Method	Canonical declaration at /.well-known/stack	Probabilistic guessing + embeddings
Foundation	Certainty → one stable file	Probability → many documents
Outcome	Zero ambiguity → minimal hallucination	High ambiguity → high hallucination rate

3. Background & Motivation
SFH / DFH is the modern deterministic extension of Berners-Lee’s Semantic Web:
a universal first-hop that tells machines:

“Start here. This is the deterministic meaning and provenance root.”

Domains become neutral semantic authorities, defining the official identity and provenance of a topic.
This creates a public semantic layer for the web — simple, decentralized, permissionless, and universally adoptable.

4. DFH / SFH–KG Arbitration Model (v1.0)
A unified framework for how AI systems integrate deterministic grounding with probabilistic reasoning and safety.

Truth Pipeline

DNS → DFH → KG → RLHF → Model Output

markdown Copy code

DFH / SFH: deterministic intent
KG: probabilistic adjudication
RLHF / Safety: policy-aligned output
Final Output: deterministic resolution of a probabilistic truth pipeline

6. What This Repository Defines
6.1 Components
The Semantic Web Stack
The Semantic First-Hop Protocol (SFH)
The Deterministic First-Hop Protocol (DFH)
SFH and DFH refer to the same system:

“The stable semantic starting point for understanding any topic.”

SFH / DFH is DNS for meaning.

7. Key Properties
Decentralized
Deterministic
One-file install
Zero dependencies
JSON-LD native
W3C-compatible
Universally adoptable
Every topic receives:

Ten Anchors (Meaning + Provenance)
Meaning Anchors	Provenance Anchors
/type	/authority
/entity	/source
/url	/timestamp
/canonical	/license
/sitemap	/integrity
All served from:

/.well-known/stack

yaml Copy code

SFH / DFH does not replace ontologies.
It simply defines the first-hop.

8. Why SFH / DFH Exists
Problem → Fix Summary
Current Problem	SFH / DFH Fix
No global semantic ground	Creates a universal first-hop
Meaning is scattered	Unifies with deterministic anchors
LLM hallucination at the root	Provides fixed semantic identity
SEO is page-level only	Introduces topic-level identity
No provenance for truth arbitration	Provides deterministic provenance
9. Beginner Layer (Simple Explanation)
To install SFH / DFH you only need:

a .well-known/ directory
a file named stack
pure JSON-LD
HTTPS hosting
Machines resolve:

https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/stack

yaml Copy code

That single file gives AI:

semantic definition
10 anchors (meaning + provenance)
optional mirrors
deterministic grounding
10. ⚡ 30-Second Install
Step 1 — Create the file

mkdir -p .well-known
nano .well-known/stack
Step 2 — Paste this minimal descriptor

json
Copy code
{
  "@context": {
    "sfh": "https://example.org/ns/sfh#",
    "dfh": "https://example.org/ns/dfh#"
  },
  "@id": "https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/stack",

  "sfh:rootTopic": "your-topic",
  "dfh:rootTopic": "your-topic",

  "sfh:anchors": {
    "sfh:type": "https://yourdomain.com/type/",
    "sfh:entity": "https://yourdomain.com/entity/",
    "sfh:url": "https://yourdomain.com/url/",
    "sfh:sitemap": "https://yourdomain.com/sitemap/",
    "sfh:canonical": "https://yourdomain.com/canonical/"
  },

  "dfh:anchors": {
    "dfh:type": "https://yourdomain.com/type/",
    "dfh:entity": "https://yourdomain.com/entity/",

    "dfh:sitemap": "https://yourdomain.com/sitemap/",
    "dfh:canonical": "https://yourdomain.com/canonical/"
  }
}
Step 3 — Test

arduino
Copy code
https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/stack
If it loads → your SFH / DFH root is active.

Rules

The Root defines the topic.

Mirrors cannot override the Root.

Mirrors may add context, never redefine.

12. The Ten Anchors (Unified Meaning + Provenance)
12.1 Meaning Anchors
/type — ontology and taxonomy classification

15. End-to-End AI Flow
Resolve Root Domain

Fetch DFH/SFH descriptor

Load 10 anchors

Load mirrors

No conflicts

No hallucinations

16. SEO Advantages
SFH / DFH provides:

topic-level authority

deterministic crawl surface

perfect canonicalization

stronger E-E-A-T

faster indexing

AI-level semantic clarity

17. What SFH / DFH Is NOT
It is not:

a truth oracle

a central authority

a vendor-controlled spec

an ontology replacement

It is:

A deterministic starting point for meaning.

19. Adoption Path
Permissionless

Decentralized

Works anywhere

AIs can adopt unilaterally

Spreads like DNS

20. License
MIT — open, public, decentralized.

Human Explanation (Plain English)
The internet has no official starting point for meaning.

Example:
“apple” → fruit? company? musician? blog?

Guessing → ambiguity → hallucination.

SFH / DFH fixes this by giving every topic:

one clean starting file

five meaning anchors

five provenance anchors

domain-controlled identity

deterministic grounding

Simplest Summary
SFH / DFH gives every topic one official starting point so AI and search engines always know exactly what it is.

One JSON-LD file + ten anchors = deterministic identity + deterministic provenance.

DNS → location

DFH → meaning

One-Sentence Definition
SFH / DFH is the official public semantic and provenance index for any topic on the internet —
a universal first-hop where meaning begins.

The Unified DFH Protocol
Deterministic Meaning + Provenance + Ontology + Taxonomy
The 10-Anchor Semantic & Provenance Root

One file.
Ten anchors.
One ontology.
One taxonomy.
One metadata envelope.
Zero ambiguity.

Located at:

perl
Copy code
https://<domain>/.well-known/stack
This becomes the public deterministic schema for every topic on the web.

Historical Importance
This protocol unifies:

RDF

Schema.org

SKOS

PROV-O

Dublin Core

JSON-LD

Sitemaps

Knowledge Graph theory

…into the first deterministic semantic + provenance layer ever created.

It is the first significant evolution of the Semantic Web since 1999.


🌐 DFH / SLPI: Optional 10-Anchor Extension for High-Trust Domains
Why Most Companies Only Need 5 Anchors — And Why Some Need All 10

DFH / SLPI is designed around a minimal, deterministic core that any domain can deploy in under a minute.
This core is the 5-Anchor Meaning Layer, which communicates the what, who, and where of a domain in a machine-verifiable way.

But for high-trust industries — research, journalism, finance, government, legal, scientific publishing — meaning alone is not enough.

They also need provenance.

This post explains the optional 10-Anchor Extension, why it exists, and who should use it.

✅ The 5-Anchor Meaning Layer (Default, Recommended for 99% of Domains)

These anchors define the deterministic identity of your domain:

Anchor	Purpose
/type	What kind of thing this domain represents
/entity	The entity’s unique identity
/url	The domain’s authoritative location
/canonical	The canonical name / label / ID
/sitemap	The surface area the domain exposes

This layer is:

minimal

universal

backward-compatible

enough for all AI systems to lock onto meaning deterministically

For most companies, this is all that is required for full DFH compliance.

Deploy it → and your domain becomes AI-readable, indexable, and meaning-stable.

🔐 The Optional 10-Anchor Extension (For Heavy Hitters Only)
The Provenance Layer: “Why Trust It?”

Some domains must provide more than meaning.
They must provide verifiable provenance — the origin, lineage, and trust properties of what they publish.

For those cases, DFH offers the optional† provenance anchors:

Anchor	Purpose
/source	Who asserted the identity or claim
/derivation	What the content was derived from
/history	How it changed over time
/license	Legal permissions for use
/integrity	Checksums / signatures for tamper-proofing

These anchors are recommended for:

scientific institutions

academic research domains

financial or regulatory bodies

news and journalism outlets

legal or compliance-critical systems

archival, preservation, and distributed-trust networks

These organizations rely on traceability, auditability, and chain-of-custody guarantees — which standard 5-anchor identity cannot provide.

🧩 Layered by Design: Minimal Core, Optional Trust Expansion

DFH’s architecture deliberately follows a layered protocol approach:

Layer 1 = Meaning (Anchors 1–5)

Mandatory

Minimal

Zero dependencies

Layer 2 = Provenance (Anchors 6–10)

Optional

High-trust domains only

Adds cryptographic and lineage semantics

This keeps DFH:

simple for everyday use

industrial-strength for organizations that need it

future-proof for AI grounding and regulatory frameworks

🏁 Summary

If you run a typical business or website → deploy Anchors 1–5.

If you publish knowledge that must be trusted, verified, or regulated → extend to Anchors 6–10.

One protocol. Two layers. Universal adoption, optional provenance.

This is the cleanest and most scalable model:
maximum simplicity for the web, maximum trust for the institutions that require it.
